# Data analysis using Excel
This project involved gathering, cleaning, and modeling data to derive meaningful insights using Excel. I performed comprehensive data analysis to transform raw data into a refined dataset. From there, I built an interactive dashboard that provides a clear and concise visual representation of key metrics. The dashboard highlights important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and trends, allowing users to explore the data dynamically and gain insights into critical business aspects. The project demonstrates strong skills in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization, using Excel to deliver actionable insights for decision-making.
